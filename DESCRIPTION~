Description: Linear Regression Cell Type-Specific Differential Expression Power
    Analysis. Feeding lrcde a samples by genomic sites matrix of heterogeneous
    expression measures, cell proportions, and a group membership vector, then
    cell type-specific expression is estimated using linear regression per group.
    Differences are take between group-wise estiamates per cell type per genomic
    site. Power is calculated for per cell type per gene for each difference
    estimate based on standard errors of coefficient estiamtes.
